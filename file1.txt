2. ===	Used to test equality within a when clause of a case statement.	(1...10) === 5 returns true.
3. .eql?	True if the receiver and argument have both the same type and equal values.	1 == 1.0 returns true, but 1.eql?(1.0) is false.
4. equal?	True if the receiver and argument have the same object id.	if aObj is duplicate of bObj then aObj == bObj is true, a.equal?bObj is false but a.equal?aObj is true.
